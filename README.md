# Smart-Fire-Detection-and-Alert-System-using-Arduino-Proteus-and-LabVIEW
This project is designed to detect fire using sensors interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller. The system simulates real-time fire detection in Proteus and visualizes the data in LabVIEW for monitoring and alerting. It enhances safety by providing instant alerts and can be applied in homes, industries, and public spaces.

Using Arduino, Proteus Simulation, and LabVIEW Interface
# 📘 Project Overview
This project presents a Smart Fire Detection and Alert System that integrates Arduino, Proteus simulation, and LabVIEW GUI to detect fire hazards in real-time and notify users instantly. It is designed for early fire detection in homes, offices, and industries to ensure safety and reduce response time during emergencies.

# 🎯 Objectives

Detect fire or smoke using sensor input.

Visualize sensor data and system status in LabVIEW.

Simulate and test the circuit using Proteus before hardware implementation.

Trigger real-time alerts such as buzzers or visual warnings.

# 🧰 Technologies Used

Arduino UNO – Microcontroller for processing sensor data.

Proteus Design Suite – Circuit simulation and testing.

LabVIEW – GUI for real-time data monitoring and alert display.

Flame Sensor / MQ-2 Gas Sensor – Detects fire or smoke.

Buzzer / LED – Alert mechanisms.

Serial Communication (COM Port) – Data transfer between Arduino and LabVIEW.

# 🛠️ Features

Real-time fire detection with visual and sound alerts.

LabVIEW interface displays fire status and sensor data.

Simulation through Proteus ensures error-free design.

Easily expandable to include GSM/email alerts or cloud logging.

# 📦 Project Components

FireDetection.ino – Arduino code for sensor reading and alerting.

ProteusDesign.pdsprj – Simulated circuit design file.

LabVIEW_FireAlert.vi – LabVIEW Virtual Instrument file for GUI.

README.md – Documentation.

Optional: Circuit schematic, screenshots, or report PDF.

# 🔧 How to Run the Project
# 🧪 Simulation Setup:

Open ProteusDesign.pdsprj in Proteus.

Upload the compiled hex file from FireDetection.ino.

Run the simulation to observe sensor activity and output.

# 🖥️ LabVIEW Setup:
Connect Arduino to PC via USB.

Open LabVIEW_FireAlert.vi.

Set the correct COM port in the VI.

Run the VI to start real-time monitoring.

# 📊 Output
Fire detected: Buzzer ON, LabVIEW status = "FIRE ALERT".

No fire: System in standby, LabVIEW shows "SAFE".

# 🚀 Future Enhancements
GSM module for SMS alerting.

IoT-based cloud monitoring using Blynk or ThingSpeak.

Integration with a sprinkler or suppression system.
