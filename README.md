# Smart-Fire-Detection-and-Alert-System-using-Arduino-Proteus-and-LabVIEW
This project is designed to detect fire using sensors interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller. The system simulates real-time fire detection in Proteus and visualizes the data in LabVIEW for monitoring and alerting. It enhances safety by providing instant alerts and can be applied in homes, industries, and public spaces.
